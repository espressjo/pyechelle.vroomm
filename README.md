PyEchelle++
===========
PyEchelle++ is a simulation tool, to generate realistic 2D spectra, in particular 
cross-dispersed echelle spectra. It allows to simulate arbitrary spectra for any 
fiber-fed or slit spectrograph, where a model file is available. Optical aberrations are 
treated accurately, the simulated spectra include photon and read-out noise.
